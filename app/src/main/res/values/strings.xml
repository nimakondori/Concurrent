    <string name="Description_1">1.\tTo use the app click on the start button in the main menu. This will trigger a bubble on the screen that can be moved around on the screen\n\n
    2.\tOpen the app that contains a heart view ultrasound that you want analyze\n\n
    3.\tClick on the bubble, and you will see a menu pop up under the bubble\n\n
    4.\tClick on the quality. Place your finger on one fo the corners of the heart image and slide your finger diagonally to choose the frame that contains the heart view\n\n
    \t\t\t\t - If the frame is not ideal, you can click on the bubble again and click on REFRAME button to choose the frame again
    5.\tYou will see another pop up that has a quality bar and a view prediction field\n\n
    6.\tIf the predicted view is AP4 or AP2, you can see the ejection fraction calculation
        along with the heart Left Ventricle segmentation. To do that, click on the bubble and click on the segmentation button\n\n
    7.\t Remember that if the heart view changes while the app is doing the segmentation then the EF calculation and Segmentation might not be accurate.\n
    To maximize the accuracy, run the quality module again then go back to segmentation if it is available for the new heart view\n\n
    8.\tThis will trigger remove the quality bar and add another tool that has the EF calculations and pressing on that bar will show the live LV segmentation\n\n\n
    This app was developed by Robotics and Control Labs in University of British Columbia for research purposes only.\n</string>
